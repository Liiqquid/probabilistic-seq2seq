# probabilistic-seq2seq
 
## Project Overview
The **`probabilistic-seq2seq`** repository provides an advanced implementation of a **Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence)** model designed for **probabilistic forecasting**. While the standard Seq2Seq model is widely used for sequence prediction tasks, this version extends it to predict not only point estimates but also **confidence intervals**. This is particularly valuable for applications in **time series analysis**, where predicting the range of possible future outcomes is as important as providing an exact prediction. Use cases include:
- **Weather forecasting**
- **Realized volatility prediction**
- **Demand forecasting**

## Usage - Model Description
The model consists of several components:
- **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.
- **Decoder**: Takes the context vector and generates the output sequence.
- **Attention Mechanism**: (Optional) Focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding.
